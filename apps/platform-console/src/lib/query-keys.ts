/**
 * Query Key Factory — centralized, type-safe cache keys for TanStack Query.
 * Rules:
 * - All keys live here; no hardcoded strings in hooks/pages.
 * - Lists use objects for filters: ['users', { params }]
 * - Detail keys are predictable: ['users', id]
 * - Invalidations target parent scopes (e.g. invalidate 'users' clears list + detail)
